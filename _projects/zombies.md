## Zombies are here! Mathematical models for the Doomsday Scenario

What would you do in the doomsday scenario? Well I know what I would do, sit down and mathematically model the outbreak (probably not the best course of action I reckon, but oh well ...). For this project, I extend the work of [Munz et al. (2009)](https://loe.org/images/content/091023/Zombie%20Publication.pdf). I simulate how changing certain parameters affect system stability and the outbreak.
